## Power of two
* 10 -> 1 thousand -> 1 KB
* 20 -> 1 million -> 1 MB
* 30 -> 1 billion -> 1 GB
* 40 -> 1 trillion -> 1 TB
* 50 -> 1 Quadrillion -> 1 PB

## Latency numbers
* L1 cache reference -> 0.5 ns
* Branch mispredict -> 5 ns
* L2 cache reference -> 7 ns
* Mutex lock/unlock -> 100 ns
* Main memory reference -> 100 ns
* Compress 1K bytes with Zippy -> 10,000 ns = 10 us
* Send 2K bytes over 1 Gbps network -> 20,000 ns = 20 us
* Read 1 MB sequentially from memory -> 250,000 ns = 250 us
* Round trip within the same datacenter -> 500,000 ns = 500 us
* Disk seek -> 10,000,000 ns = 10 ms
* Read 1 MB sequentially from the network -> 10,000,000 ns = 10 ms
* Read 1 MB sequentially from disk -> 30,000,000 ns = 30 ms
* Send packet CA (California) -> Netherlands -> CA = 150,000,000 ns = 150 ms

ns = naosecond = 10^-9 second  
us = microsecond = 10^-6 second  
ms = millisecond = 10^-3 second
